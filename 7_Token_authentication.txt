To login to any site ., we need id, password --> thet have to send request to endpoint 
then we ruturn them token --> aftern login they use this token to visit any url of the site 
Headers --> key, authorization,value --> they will carry this token to each page or else they can't access 
If user is authenticated then we check whether they are carrimg token or not

USER --> REGISTER --> THEN WE GENERATE TOKEN (new field in database) ., once user is registered they get token 
Once the user logout ., then this token is destroyed
After logout then user again need to login., new token is generated 

REST_FRAMEWORK = {
    'DEFAULT_PERMISSION_CLASSES': [
        'rest_framework.authentication.TokenAuthentication',
    ]
}

Then we need to install a app 
INSTALLED_APPS = [
     'rest_framework.authtoken'
]

Then we need to migrate because we need to create table that is going to store table for each individual

After this when ever we are sending request in postman with reviews url --> then in Headers we have to give 
KEY, as Authorization , then token as copy from admin panel where we genrated copy that token and then
Token <token key> then pass we can access 


For sending request also in postman or modifying the body even if we logged in we have to pass key, value in headers 
and also see which user is logged and sending request, nodified content through that user or not 

How to get the token?
Till now we are creating through admin panel and copying that token and using postman headers
create a login link --> send a request through postman with username and password --> then link is giving return in form of response in form of token 
We are storing that token  --> case 1 Login 

Case 2 --> User Registration --> After registration once after getting username, password,email  as well confirm password , then login it and create a token 
case 3 --> Logout --> destroy the token 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Part -3 --> Login 

lets create separate app for this user_app 
we are creating this to keep login,logout,register separately 

We created api folder --> then inside it we created serializers.py, urls.py, views.py 

Then include the url in main urls.py watchmate

   path('account/',include('user_app.api.urls'))

Then we can proceed
by default django provide obtain auth token 

In urls.py in user_app 

#This will give us access to token if we send username,password
from rest_framework.authtoken.views import obtain_auth_token
from django.urls import path 

urlpatterns = [
    path('login/',obtain_auth_token, name='login'),
]


Then if we pass key, value in body of the url http://127.0.0.1:8000/account/login/

and pass key, value as username --> kalakoti, password --> bharath and send post request we get token in postman 

and if we re-login again same token we wil get until we delete it 


send a request and get token --> here all done by obtain_auth_token
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Lets work on registration part 


model --> serializers-->view --> then create a url 

After register how to access 

Then after this I had used register user to create creds by passing username,email,password,password2 --> sent as post request

Then after registering passed username,password in body in login url to see the token 

Then once we create account we can login account and we have access to everything

Suppose if we want this token after creating account to login 

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Next tasks:
1.Create Token automatically
2.Return the token with Response 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
for every registered user when registered token is created.

By using signals we can auto genarate token for users 

In models.py register 


in views see below 

from rest_framework.decorators import api_view, permission_classes
from rest_framework.permissions import AllowAny
from rest_framework.response import Response
from rest_framework.authtoken.models import Token

from user_app.api.serializers import RegistrationSerializer


@api_view(['POST',])
@permission_classes([AllowAny])          # ‚Üê this lets unauthenticated users in
def registration_view(request):
    if request.method == 'POST':
        serializer = RegistrationSerializer(data=request.data)
        
        data = {}
        
        if serializer.is_valid():
            account = serializer.save()

            data['response'] = 'Registration successful!'
            data['username'] = account.username
            data['email'] = account.email
            
            token = Token.objects.get(user=account).key 
            data['token'] = token
        else:
            data = serializer.errors
        
        return Response(data) 
        
token is created but automatic token is not created
our token is not created automatically 
Because we are not calling model that's the reason token is not created automatically 

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Logout(How to delete a token)

@api_view(['POST',])
def logout_view(request):
    
    if request.method == 'POST':
        request.user.auth_token.delete()
        return Response(status=status.HTTP_200_OK)
    

 path('logout/',logout_view,name='logout')
