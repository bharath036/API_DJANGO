Throttling Introduction

It is similar to permission but their is a big difference

When we use permission class we have the power to restrict the access
either by checking the user if they are authenticated or not or we can customize it 

When we using throttling we have the power to restrict user by the number of requests
Ex: Medium --> we can send 10-15 request (blog post read ) after that we need to register 

In our app now any number of times they can send requests.., here we are implementing restrictions 

AnonrateThrottle , UserRate throttle 

Annon for annonimous user(not registed user)
UserRate (registered user)

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Throttle Rate(Anon and User)

The below we imported in settings.py which we implemented this globally
Here total we send for all overall classes .., if we give to each view class then 
we can controll for particular view 

REST_FRAMEWORK = {
    'DEFAULT_THROTTLE_CLASSES': [
        'rest_framework.throttling.AnonRateThrottle',
        'rest_framework.throttling.UserRateThrottle'
    ],

    #Rate limit for anoninous user and register user 
    'DEFAULT_THROTTLE_RATES': {
        'anon': '100/day',
        'user': '1000/day'
    }
}

If we want restriction for review .., then 
we need to import in views

from rest_framework.throttling import UserRateThrottle, AnnonRateThrottle
Then view classes we add this line

throttle_classes = [UserRateThrottle]

Like this we can restrict the request rates

How to customize throttle 
Scoperate throttle

How to restict to view 10 number of review but can add only review per day 

in throttling.py file
from rest_framework.throttling import UserRateThrottle

class ReviewCreateThrottle(UserRateThrottle):
    scope = 'review-create'

class ReviewListThrottle(UserRateThrottle):
    scope = 'review-list'

in settings.py take scope and add limit 
    'DEFAULT_THROTTLE_RATES': {
        'anon': '1/day',
        'user': '3/day',
        'review-create': '1/day',
        'review-list' : '10/day'
    }Create a new file in watchlist_app --> api --> throttling.py
