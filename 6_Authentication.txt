Intro to AUTHENTICATION

Authentication itself wont allow or disallow incoming request .
It just prove that a user is logged in or a user is valid user 
Whether user can access it is or not controlled by permission 
If we work anything related to restriction, it relate to permission 

Authentication help use to check any incoming request whether a user is identified user or not.


This basic authentication is only for testing purpose. 

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Basic Authentication 

REST_FRAMEWORK = {
    'DEFAULT_PERMISSION_CLASSES': [
        'rest_framework.authentication.BasicAuthentication',
    ]
}

--> Add this in settings.py 

Add authentication classes then 
give url in postman --> then in headers pass key value --> key as Authorization , value as Basic kalakoti:password --> if we pass like this we wil get error as we need to pass as base64encode 
instead of that pass as Basic <base64encode> --> this works 



in watchmate --> urls.py 
    #path('api-auth',include('rest_framework.urls')) --> this temporary login not be used., we will use our own authentication
